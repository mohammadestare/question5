5. Get Student Top Notes
Create a function that takes an array of students and returns an array of their top
notes. If the student does not have notes then let's assume their top note is equal to 0.
Examples
getStudentTopNotes([
{
id: 1,
name: "Jacek",
notes: [5, 3, 4, 2, 5, 5]
},
{
id: 2,
name: "Ewa",
notes: [2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 5]
},
{
id: 3,
name: "Zygmunt",
notes: [2, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3]
}
])
âžž output: [5, 5, 4]
